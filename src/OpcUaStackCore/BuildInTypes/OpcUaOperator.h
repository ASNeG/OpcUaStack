		// ObjectType or VariableType Node or a reference to another element which is a
		// RelatedTo operator.
		// [2]: Any operand that resolves to a NodeId that identifies a ReferenceType Node.
		// [3]: Any operand that resolves to a value implicitly convertible to Uint32.
		// [4]: Any operand that resolves to a value implicitly convertible to a boolean; if this
		// operand does not resolve to a Boolean, then a value of FALSE is used.
		// [5]: Any operand that resolves to a value implicitly convertible to a boolean; if this
		// operand does not resolve to a Boolean, then a value of FALSE is used.
		// If none of the operands [0],[1],[2],[3] resolves to an appropriate value then the result
