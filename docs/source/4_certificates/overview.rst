Overview
===========================

OPC UA applications typically have Application Instance Certificates to provide application level
security. They are used for establishing a secure connection using Asymmetric Cryptography.
These Application Instance Certificates are Digital Certificates which are X.509 Certificates and
contain a list of data items that are defined in the OPC UA specification Part 4. hese data
items describe the Application Instance that the Digital Certificate is assigned to.

The Digital Certificates include a Digital Signature by the generator of the Certificate. This Digital
Signature can be self-signed (The signature is generated by the Private Key associated with X.509
Certificate that is the Application Instance Certificate) or can be signed by a Certificate Authority
(The signature is generated by the Private Key associated the X.509 Certificate of the CA). Both
types of Certificates provide the same level of security and can be used in Asymmetric
Cryptography. The Signatures can be generated using a variety of algorithms, where the alg orithms
provide different levels of security (128 bit, 256 bit, 512 bit ...). The algorithm that is required for
signing a certificate is specified as part of the Security Policy. Servers and Clients should be able to
support more than one certificate since more than one certificate may be required depending on the
Security Profiles that are being supported.

Asymmetric Cryptography makes use of two keys â€“ a Private Key and a Public Key. An application
will have a list of trusted Public Keys that represent the applications it trusts. This list of trusted
Public Keys is stored either in the Windows Registry or a file folder. It will also have a Private Key
that corresponds to its Application Instance Certificate. The application can use a Public Key, from
its list, to validate that the signature on a received connection request was generated by the
corresponding Private Key. An application can also use the Public Key of the target application to
encrypt data, which can only be decrypted using t he Private Key of the target application.
